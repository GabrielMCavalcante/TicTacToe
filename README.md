> This is a project where you can play <strong>tic tac toe</strong> on your computer.

This project is a simple adaptation of the popular game Tic Tac Toe, where players play with knots and crosses (O and X), trying
to have a row, a column or a diagonal full of their chosen tile. In this project you can also play against the computer with a simulated AI.
